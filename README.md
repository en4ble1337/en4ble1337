# Bart Dworzanczyk

**Lead Technical Architect @ ePlus | From BGP to RAG**

12+ years designing enterprise data center and campus networks. Now building secure, scalable AI solutions on the infrastructure I know inside out.

This GitHub is a working portfolio. Every repo here is something I built, broke, fixed, and documented along the way. I learn by doing, not by watching.

## Certifications

**AI and Cloud:** NVIDIA · AWS 

**Networking:** Cisco 

## AI and GenAI Projects

| Project | What It Does | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [**Transcribo AI**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/Transcribo-AI) | Fast, offline AI dictation that types into any app. Features NPU hardware acceleration for instant, private voice to text. | Python, Whisper, Local Inference |
| [**AI Assistant with RAG (Discord)**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/AI-Assistant-with-RAG---Discord---Release-1.0) | My first GenAI project. Local first RAG chatbot using Ollama and ChromaDB. Took an OpenAI dependent project and rebuilt it to run entirely on local LLMs. Expanding to additional platforms. | Python, LangChain, Ollama, ChromaDB, HuggingFace |
| [**Project Launchpad**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/project-launchpad) | A 4 phase workflow that transforms vague ideas into hallucination proof codebases. Systematic approach to AI assisted project development. | Methodology, Prompt Engineering |
| [**vLLM on Proxmox LXC**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/vllm-proxmox-lxc-guide) | Installation guide for running vLLM inside Proxmox LXC containers with GPU passthrough and PagedAttention for high throughput local inference. | vLLM, Proxmox, NVIDIA, LXC |

## MCP Integrations (Model Context Protocol)

Where my networking background meets AI. These MCP servers connect AI assistants directly to enterprise infrastructure, turning hours of manual vendor portal work into conversational queries.

| Project | What It Does | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [**Cisco Support MCP Server**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/mcp-cisco-support) | Connects AI assistants to Cisco Support APIs (46 tools across 8 APIs) for automated infrastructure assessments, bug tracking, EOL analysis, and security advisories. Built a custom Claude skill on top for generating client ready assessment reports. | TypeScript, MCP, Cisco APIs, Claude Skills |
| [**Pure Storage MCP Server**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/pure-storage-model-context-protocol) | Hybrid MCP server for Pure Storage fleet management. Collaborated directly with Pure Storage engineers on API wrappers that enable AI driven health checks, capacity forecasting, and TAM reporting. | Python, MCP, Pure1 API, FlashArray/FlashBlade |

## GPU Infrastructure and Compute

Building and operating GPU compute infrastructure to support AI/ML workloads on Proxmox.

| Project | What It Does | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [**Proxmox GPU Dashboard**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/proxmox-gpu-dashboard) | Native NVIDIA GPU monitoring for Proxmox VE. Solves the missing GPU visibility problem for anyone running AI/ML workloads on Proxmox. | Shell, Proxmox VE, NVIDIA |
| [**GPU Passthrough for Proxmox LXC**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/GPU-Passthrough-for-Proxmox-LXC-Container) | Step by step guide for NVIDIA GPU passthrough to LXC containers, enabling containerized AI/ML workloads with direct GPU hardware access. | Shell, Proxmox, NVIDIA Drivers |
| [**Proxmox Tools**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/proxmox-tools) | Utilities for Proxmox VE management, LXC container configuration, and infrastructure automation. | Shell |

## Infrastructure and Automation

| Project | What It Does | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [**Kubernetes Noob Guide**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/kubernetes-noob-guide) | From scratch Kubernetes cluster deployment on Ubuntu with containerd, Calico, and support for AKS/GKE. Includes component breakdowns and deployment scripts. | Shell, Kubernetes, containerd |
| [**Ansible Proxmox**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/Ansible-Proxmox) | Infrastructure as Code for Proxmox environments. Automated provisioning and configuration management. | Ansible, Python, Proxmox API |
| [**OpenWebUI + SearXNG**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/openwebui-searxng) | Self hosted AI chat interface with private web search integration. | Docker, SearXNG, Open WebUI |
| [**Nginx OPNsense Cloudflare**](https://github.com/en4ble1337/ngnix-opnsense-cloudflare) | Reverse proxy and security configuration for self hosted services behind Cloudflare. | Nginx, OPNsense, Cloudflare |

## What I Am Working On

Focused on agentic workflows and AI agents as the next evolution of enterprise automation. Exploring edge voice AI, which I believe will fundamentally change how people interact with infrastructure and business systems. Building more MCP integrations for enterprise platforms. Documenting everything as I go.
